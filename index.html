				<h1>Hi there!</h1>
				<p class="lead">I'm Edmond, a twenty-something year old software developer from San Francisco, with an emphasis on mobile software and embedded systems. 
				
				<br /> <br />
				For college, I majored at UC Santa Cruz in Computer Engineering. Besides my academic hardware background, I also developed my career interests in mobile applications. Early on, I started playing an augmented reality game called Ingress, Pokemon Go's big brother and I was so intrigued how it implemented augmented reality. After my internship at NASA on front-end development, I realized that mobile development to me is a hybrid between embedded and front-end software. In iOS or Android, I can use hardware elements such as the camera, sensors, and an internet connection, yet I also have the benefits of object-oriented programming such as unit testing and app architecture.
				
				<br /> <br />
				As a software developer, I have developed IoT systems and a supporting user interface, based on a client's requirements. My biggest accomplishment so far is I developed a QR scanning system based on using multiple cameras on a Raspberry Pi and the Android and iOS applications that integrated with it by Bluetooth Low Energy, for food traceability. Our design competed with a competitor design, and ours was 50% cheaper and 75% faster, while scanning half-inch QR codes with great accuracy.
				
				<br /> <br />
				Outside of my professional role, I have donated my time and expertise to mentor a local high school robotics team. Besides teaching about robot electronics and code, I have pushed the team's programmers to look into a machine learning framework called Caffe to implement object detection to help augment their autonomous programs. When I am not thinking about coding, I may be found in my local hackerspace or taking part of activities or events based around Ingress.</p>
