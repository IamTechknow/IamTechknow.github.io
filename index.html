				<h1>Hi there!</h1>
				<p class="lead">I'm Edmond, a twenty-something year old software engineer from San Francisco. I have been part of a variety of projects involving embedded Linux, microcontrollers, and mobile apps. Most recently I am interested in full-stack development, including web and mobile front end, REST APIs, and service-oriented architecture.</p>
				
				<p class="lead">As part of my detail-oriented personalty, I seek opportunities to utilize technology for real-world applications, whether to improve everyday tasks or to support new ways to interact with the world. I thrive in work environments that value cohesiveness and autonomy as a team.</p>
				
				<p class="lead">As a software engineer, I was part of a project to develop a QR scanning system based on multiple cameras on a Raspberry Pi and Android and iOS applications made to integrate with it for food traceability. Our design was 50% cheaper and 75% faster than a competitor design, while accurately scanning half-inch QR codes. More recently, I was part of a group effort to develop the front end of a short term rental website, where I integrated checkout and calendar components to ensure smooth booking.</p>
				
				<p class="lead">Outside of my professional role, I have donated my time and expertise to mentor a local high school robotics team. Besides teaching about robot electronics and code, I have pushed the team's programmers to look into a machine learning framework called Caffe to implement object detection to help augment their autonomous programs. When I am not thinking about coding, I may be found in my local hackerspace or taking part of activities and events based around Ingress and GORUCK.</p>
